This is a mirror of bpf-next linux tree
(https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next)
bpf-next/tools/lib/bpf directory plus its supporting header files.

The following files will by sync'ed with bpf-next repo:
  src/ <-> bpf-next/tools/lib/bpf/
  include/uapi/linux/{bpf.h,btf.h} <-> bpf-next/tools/include/uapi/linux/{bpf.h,btf.h}
  include/tools/libc_compat.h <-> bpf-next/tools/include/tools/libc_compat.h

Other header files at this repo (include/linux/*.h) are reduced versions of
their counterpart files at bpf-next/tools/include/linux/*.h to make compilation
successful.
